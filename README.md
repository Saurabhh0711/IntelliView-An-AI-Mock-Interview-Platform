# IntelliView: An AI Mock Interview Platform

The IntelliView initiative represents a pioneering endeavor designed to empower novice job seekers through the integration of state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. This platform employs a sophisticated blend of FrontEnd, Flask, CNN and the Deep Face method, introducing a comprehensive framework to redefine interview assessment and augment job application preparation. The primary module facilitates text-based analysis, enabling users to engage with real-time interview questions by entering responses directly into the web interface. Subsequently, advanced algorithms compare users' responses to expected answers, yielding a percentage similarity score and presenting the correct answer. Beyond affording essential interview practice, this feature furnishes constructive feedback, enhancing users' responses and ultimately refining their interview performance. In the second module, IntelliView introduces a dynamic interview environment with video-based analysis. Users respond to inquiries utilizing webcams, enabling the system to meticulously record both verbal responses and facial expressions. Leveraging the Deep Face method, the platform
conducts real-time emotion and sentiment analysis, offering users insights into their emotional states throughout interviews.
This feedback facilitates the refinement of non-verbal communication skills, empowering candidates to recognize emotional tendencies and adapt interview strategies accordingly. The third module functions as a comprehensive resume builder, employing FrontEnd Technologies to provide diverse templates tailored to individual needs. In summation, IntelliView heralds a transformative paradigm in
job application preparation, seamlessly amalgamating technological advancements and human interaction to equip first-time job seekers with the requisite tools for navigating the competitive job market successfully.
